                <p>This site provides a tool to display analyses from the UN Environment-supported Global Methane Assessment to support decision making regarding methane emissions. Users enter the potential methane emissions reductions (or increases) associated with any action of interest, ranging from individual projects to national or international action plans. The tool then provides quantitative values for multiple impacts of those emissions reductions. These include their effects on climate change and ground-level ozone concentrations, and then via those environmental changes the resulting impacts on human health, agricultural crops and the economy. Results are based upon a set of coordinated modeling studies undertaken using the following models: the CESM2(WACCM6) model developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, CO, USA; the GFDL AM4.1/ESM4.1 model developed by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration in Princeton, NJ, USA; the GISS E2.1/E2.1-G model developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Agency in New York, NY, USA; the MIROC-CHASER model developed by the Meteorological Research Institute in Tsukuba, Japan; and the UKESM1 model developed by the UK Meteorological Office, Exeter, UK and the UK academic community.</p>
