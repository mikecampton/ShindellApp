                <p>Methane emissions have been increasing rapidly, making it especially pressing to change the trajectory of this greenhouse gas. Not only does methane lead to large amounts of near-term warming, but the tropospheric ozone created as a result of methane emissions is harmful to both humans and natural ecosystems.</p>
                <p>The urgency of the issue has prompted this UN Environment-supported Global Methane Assessment. The interactive maps on the Impacts page allow users to view the benefits of methane emissions reductions for climate, human health, agriculture and the economy. Users can enter any value of methane emissions reductions in megatons and view how that impacts each country around the world.</p>
                <p>Results are based upon a set of coordinated modeling studies undertaken using the following models: the CESM2 model developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, CO, USA; the GFDL AM3/CM3 model developed by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration in Princeton, NJ, USA; the GISS E2.1/E2.1-G model developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Agency in New York, NY, USA; the MIROC-CHASER model developed by the Meteorological Research Institute in Tsukuba, Japan; and the HadGEM3 model developed by the UK Meteorological Office, Exeter, UK.</p>
